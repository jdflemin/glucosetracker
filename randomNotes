Cant get add to work, where would i right a function/loop/if statement to save var of current user so i can display who is logged in on different page, likewise where would i set who i click to carry over to state whose page we are viewing..........I understand loops, functions, etc but i dont understand how or where to implement them....can we have a little practice of how to look up our problems and questions so we can get use to reading the docs
